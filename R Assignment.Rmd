##btc.CSV file contains bitcoin daily price from Okcoin(crypto-exchange)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#Import US quarterly GDP dataframe 
btc <- read.csv(file ='/Users/ctwo/Desktop/btc.csv')
#this csv has way too many data, data clean is necessary for this assignment
btc <- btc[-c(2,7,8)]
#drop unrelavent columns
#create a smaller dataset for better visualization
btc <- btc[c(1:10),c(1:5)] 
#change col names
names(btc)[1]<-"date"
names(btc)[2:5]<-"price"
#modify dataframe for boxplot
newdf <- melt(setDT(btc), id.vars = c("date"), variable.name = "price")
#Change factor col to int
newdf$date <-  as.integer(newdf$date)
#Finally boxplot
boxplot(value~date,data = newdf,main="Bitcoin Price of 10 Days",xlab="Exchange's timestamp",ylab="Price",col="burlywood3",border="brown4")
